## description

My best wheat sourdough bread. Result of experimentation feb 2024 - apr 2024.

The sourdough level is increased again from [chlebek.md](https://github.com/alkc/chlebki/blob/main/chlebek.md) and fermentation time is reduced. Oven temperature is kept very high with a longer steam-period.

Result is a very crunchy wheat bread with a nice carmelized/roasted crust w/ complex flavors.

Works good when shaped into oval loaf/bâtard.

## recipe

### ingredients

- Wheat flour: [Finax, Rustique, stenmalet siktat vårvetemjöl](https://www.finax.se/sv/produkter/mjol/rustique-stenmalet-siktat-varvetemjoel/)
- Spelt flour: [Saltå Kvarn, Dinkelmjöl fullkorn](https://www.saltakvarn.se/produkter/mjol/dinkelmjol-fullkorn/)

### tools

- proofing basket
- razor for scoring
- kitchen scale

#### sourdough

- 65g sourdough (preferably fed on rye or some other whole-grain flour)
- 65g water
- 65g whole-grain spelt flour 

#### main bread recipe

- All of sourdough starter
- 440g water
- 60g spelt flour
- 540g wheat flour
- 17g (1-ish tbsp) salt

#### bake 

##### day 1, morning

- mix all ingredients for sourdough, let rest until midday - evening. if yer experienced then 'til "it looks good to go".

##### day 1, afternoon/evening

1. mix all ingredients in the main bread recipe til everything is mixed together (don't knead)
2. let rest for 1h and then stretch and fold the dough 8 times (TODO: explain this part a bit better)
3. let rest for 1h and strech/fold x4
4. let rest for 1h and strech/fold x4
5. shape your loaf, stuff it in a proofing basket and let rest in fridge for up to 12 hours

##### oven bake

1. place a baking steel in oven, and at the bottom of oven put some shitty sheet pan that's not dear to you
2. preheat oven to 250C
3. optional: let oven continue to warm up for up to 30 minutes after it has reached 250C
4. remove bread from fridge, set on a baking sheet and score
5. insert bread into oven and throw one or two ice cubes onto bottom pan, bake at 250C for 15 minutes
6. remove bottom pan w/ water and bake at 250C for an addional 20 minutes, reduce to 180C for the remainder of time if yr bread has reached the desired color
7. remove from oven and let rest for ~1h before slicing

## notes

## TODO

- validate recipe with cold fermentation up to 48h
    - Only worth it if the bread gets a more complex flavor whilst still keeping its shape when baking in oven. Might need a new recipe?
    - Might need to reduce the sourdough back to 150g?
- optimize oven times/temperatures
