## notes

## todo

- try reducing dry bake from 30 min to 20 min
- try omitting diastatic malt powder (does it actually do anything?)
- try increasing sourdough from 90g to 150g (halfway between 90g and old 210g) for more flavor
- try a 5 min bake in high temp w/ steam followed by 20 min bake w/o steam for thinner crust
